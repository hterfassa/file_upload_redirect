# file_upload_redirect
The "File Upload Redirect" module is a custom Drupal module designed to enhance file upload functionality on a Drupal website. It provides a form where users can upload files and submit additional information such as their first name, last name, and email address.

Upon successful file upload, the module creates a new node of the "Resume" content type, populating the node fields with the submitted information. The uploaded file is associated with the newly created node.

Overall, the "File Upload Redirect" module streamlines the process of file uploading and creates structured content from the submitted information.
